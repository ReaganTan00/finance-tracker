Great, the charts are working. I would now like to implement the following features:

<features>
1. I would like the Breakdown by Category to show the icons of the category with the colour chosen
2. Within the Transactions page, the Category selector is currently not displaying the full text, it is clipped on the display
3. Provide a starting set of categories so that the user may use some of these common categories and please attach icons to them deemed appropriate:
    a) Fixed Expenses - Description: Recommended 35% of income, includes saving for BTO, Phone, Utilities & Subscriptions
    b) Insurance - Description: Recommended 10% of income, Life, Health, Hospitalisation, Accident, Critical Illnesses etc.
